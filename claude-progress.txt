- [ ] Consider Swift native app for iOS/macOS

## Recently Completed

### 2026-01-01: v2.0 MAJOR ARCHITECTURE OVERHAUL
- [x] Switched from Claude AI selection to deterministic algorithm
- [x] Integrated full Apple Music library (30,000+ tracks)
- [x] Added Apple Music playcount weighting (0-40 points)
- [x] Implemented selection score system
- [x] Added variety enforcement (max 3 tracks per artist)
- [x] Fixed artist filtering bug in playlist-nlp.ts
- [x] Updated all documentation (CLAUDE.md, README.md, HANDOVER-BRIEF.md)

### 2025-12-31: Spotify catalog search implemented
- [x] System now searches ~30 tracks per Include artist from Spotify
- [x] Prioritizes user's liked songs, then popular tracks
- [x] MIK data used for harmonic analysis when available

### 2025-12-31: Architecture review completed
- [x] Identified library-only limitation (was only using 4,080 MIK tracks)
- [x] Fixed Include vs Reference artist handling

## In Progress
- [ ] Apple Music matching: 29,843/48,474 (76.7%)
  - Matcher running in background
  - Saves progress every 100 tracks
  - ~11k tracks remaining

- [x] Data merge (MIK + Apple Music + Spotify search) - DONE
- [x] Deterministic selection algorithm - DONE
- [x] Variety enforcement - DONE
- [x] Documentation update - DONE

## Architecture Decisions Log
- 2026-01-01: v2.0 Deterministic Architecture
  - Removed Claude AI from track selection (kept for NLP only)
